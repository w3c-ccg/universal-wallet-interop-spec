        This document is experimental and is undergoing heavy development. It is
        inadvisable to implement the specification in its current form. An
        <a
          href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec/tree/master/packages/universal-wallet"
          >experimental implementation</a
        >
        is available.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional physical wallets are used to store a variety of personal
        assets such as cash, credit cards, driver license, health insurance, and
        business cards. Today we also have a wide variety of digital wallets to
        store and access digital versions of these same assets, with more
        options coming into the market every day. However, each wallet
        represents data and capabilities differently, sometimes intentionally to
        facilitate vendor lock in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine you had to carry a dozen different wallets with you at all
        times, and to use each one independently based on the situation. The
        wallets are disconnected, and the burden is on either the holder or the
        verifier to request all required information for each transaction. The
        result is a cumbersome user experience (not dissimilar to account and
        password management today) and expensive business implementation to
        support different wallets. What is missing is a standardized structure -
        a universal wallet - that can effectively point to and comprehend each
        digital asset in its current location. This universal wallet not only
        offers a convenient access point for people and machines to organize
        their assets (akin to a traditional physical wallet), but it also
        enables awareness and relationships between those assets as needed for
        real-world use.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this specification is to design an abstract data model
        and set of interfaces that approximate a physical wallet system and its
        common uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many existing software systems which manage subsets or
        supersets of the information represented in digital wallets. This
        specification aims to be compatible with those systems, by allowing them
        to continue to manage the information and inferfaces, so long as they
        can be adequately described at both a data model, and interface level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The property of representing data and interfaces as they exist, where
        they exist today, is a critical component of this specification. We
        fully expect this specification to live or die by its ability to achieve
        this property.
      </p>

      <h2>Wallet Types</h2>
      <p>
        There are many different kinds of digital wallet. 
        This section describes a few distinguishable categories.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Progressive Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a kind of offline capable website.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can read more about them 
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          PWAs don't require users to install an app through an app store, 
          but are limited by browser API support in ways that native mobile applications are not.
        </p>

        <p>
          PWAs can access camera, WebRTC, NFC, Bluetooth, and other browser APIs. 
          They can connect to remote apis to facilitate discovery and messaging.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Native Mobile Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Native Mobile Applications (NMAs) are software a user installs on a mobile OS, like Android or iOS.
        </p>

        <p>
          NMAs have access to APIs supported by the mobile OS, such as 
          filesystem, network, phone, or camera APIs, among others.
        </p>

        <p>
          NMAs might implement support for hardware backed secret or key 
          management via the OS. This and better biometric authentication 
          support make them attractive to high security applications.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Cloud Wallets</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud Wallets are software services hosted on the internet, typically exposed over HTTP or gRPC.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cloud Wallets offer some of the security benefits of centralization, such as logging and dynamic scaling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cloud wallets can also be "always online", in cases where a mobile wallet might lose connectivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cloud wallets and message based APIs are generally an easier integration target for legacy systems.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Cold Storage Wallets</h3>
        <p>
          Cold Storage Wallets (CSWs) are non-networked, long-term storage for digital assets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cold storage is typically reserved for very sensitive information, 
          such as keys that control large amounts of crypto currency, or root 
          certificate signing keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSWs may be implemented as either isolated hardware or physical paper.
        </p>

        <h3>HD Wallets</h3>

        <p>
          HD Wallets are a popular mechanism for managing many keys, addresess
          and accounts across multiple crypto currency ledgers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a <a>Meta Data</a> object applied to a <a>Secret</a>, a user
          instruct an application to discover <a>cryptocurrency</a> that is
          controlled by a <a>Secret</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          See <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/84">EIP84</a>
          for examples of how this is done in the ethereum community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because HD Wallet arise from blockchain applications, 
          there is some ambiguity regarding their applications to DIDs.
        </p>

        <p>
          We recommend using the Bitcoin HD path by default when generating key 
          material for a DID Method that does not provide a specific recommendation for working with HD Paths.

      mnemonic "sell antenna drama rule twenty cement mad deliver you push derive hybrid"
      hd path "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0" 
      key type "Ed25519" 
      yields 'did:key:z6MktiSzqF9kqwdU8VkdBKx56EYzXfpgnNPUAGznpicNiWfn'.
      </pre>
      <p>
        It is not recommended to use the same root key for multiple key types, so a different mnemonic and or hd path 
        combination should be used when generating a secp256k1 "did:key".

        <h3>Cloud Secret Managers</h3>

        <p>Software services that support secret or key management are useful building blocks for cloud wallets.</p>

        <p class="note">
          Some services combine secret and key operations under the 
          umbrella term "Key Management Service".  Wallets may use both 
          managed asymmetric and symmetric key operations, as well as 
          managed and versioned secrets.
